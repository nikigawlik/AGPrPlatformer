This is a small, physics based, 2D platformer.

move with W, D & spacebar. Press r for restart

You can run around on all walls, no matter the angle (withing the boudaries set by the law of gravity).

Pick up power ups for small speed boosts (multiple power ups stack for even greater speed!)

Spikes will kill you. There is no ending currently, just explore the small test level.
